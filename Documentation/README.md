# Documentation

This is documentation for Flexign v0.x.x series.

Flexign is a flexible & extendable design system with ready-to-use components for iOS written in Swift. It allows you to quickly create a reusable and conistent visual language for your app. It also greatly reduces boilerplate code for styles and common views setup. Flexign comes with hand-crafted defaults that make it very easy to just focus on your app, and not on cumbersome styling.
